# Benga
It's a game engine.

How to compile and run the current version of the engine in 5 easy steps:

1) Clone this repository (including the libraries!).
2) Run generate_projects.bat (FYI, it just runs premake to generate all the VS files).
3) Open Benga.sln in visual studio.
4) Hit ctrl + b (or right click on the solution name and click build).
5) You can now run the engine in visual studio or go to bin and look for Sanbox.exe

The engine compiles as a static library, so it's Sandbox that will implement/show the latest features.
